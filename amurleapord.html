            <p class="Amur-Leapord-facts">Amur leopards have thick white or cream fur with large, widely spaced black spots called “rosettes” covering the head, back, tail and legs.</p>
            <p class="Amur-Leapord-facts">Fur length varies from summer (0.7–0.9 in) to winter (2.8 in).</p>
            <p class="Amur-Leapord-facts">Amur leopards have long bushy tails of 32–35 in (81–89 cm).</p>
            <p class="Amur-Leapord-facts">The long length comes in handy during cold winters as they can wrap them around themselves for warmth.</p>
            <p class="Amur-Leapord-facts">Amur leopards, also known as Far East leopards, Manchurian leopards or Korean leopards, are found in the Russian Far East.</p>
            <p class="Amur-Leapord-facts">Their range is small and confined to forests of a temperate region crossed by the Amur River, a natural boundary between China and Russia.</p>
            <p class="Amur-Leapord-facts">They are the only leopard subspecies adapted to survive in both extreme snowy winter and hot summer climates.</p>
            <p class="Amur-Leapord-facts">Amur leopards are nocturnal so sleep during the day in cool caves or sheltered spots.</p>
            <p class="Amur-Leapord-facts">Amur leopards are carnivores.</p>
            <p class="Amur-Leapord-facts">They are opportunistic so are not fussy eaters, but prey consists mainly of roe and sika deer, hares, wild pigs and badgers.</p>
            <p class="Amur-Leapord-facts"> Although, when feeling brave, they have been known to eat young black bears.</p>
            <p class="Amur-Leapord-facts">Food can be scarce, so if they have food left over, they may drag and hide the remains from other predators that might fancy a nibble.</p>
            <p class="Amur-Leapord-facts">Amur leopards have rough tongues covered in tiny hooks called denticles that are used to scrape meat off the bone of their prey.</p>
            <p class="Amur-Leapord-facts">Amur leopards are highly territorial and live alone, only coming together to mate.</p>
            <p class="Amur-Leapord-facts">Individual Amur leopards can have territories of 19–116 square miles, which is the size of 56,144 football fields.</p>
            <p class="Amur-Leapord-facts">Like other leopards, Amur leopards are fast and nimble.</p>
            <p class="Amur-Leapord-facts">They can run at speeds of up to 37 miles per hour and leap up to 19 ft (5.8 m) horizontally.</p>
            <p class="Amur-Leapord-facts">In a race between Usain Bolt and an Amur leopard, there is no contest; Bolt would be left in the dust as he runs at up to 28 miles per hour.</p>
            <p class="Amur-Leapord-facts">Female Amur leopards start reproducing at three to four years of age.</p>
            <p class="Amur-Leapord-facts">A litter of between one and four cubs is born around 12 weeks after mating.</p>
            <p class="Amur-Leapord-facts">Cubs are born with their eyes closed and only begin to open them seven or eight days after birth.</p>
