        </div>
        <div class="black-background">
            <p class="list-for-tigers">Adults can weigh up to 363kg (that’s about the same as ten ten year olds!) and measure up to 3.3m!</p>
            <p class="list-for-tigers">They mainly feed on large mammals such as deer, wild pigs, antelope and buffalo.</p>
            <p class="list-for-tigers">They quietly stalk their prey until they are close enough to pounce – then they kill their victim with a bite to the neck or back of the head.</p>
            <p class="list-for-tigers">Unlike most members of the cat family, they like water and often cool off in pools or streams.</p>
            <p class="list-for-tigers">So when they want to be heard, you’ll know about it.</p>
            <p class="list-for-tigers">That’s right – they may be big and heavy, but tigers are by no means slow movers!</p>
            <p class="list-for-tigers">Fossil remains of tigers found in parts of China are believed to be 2 million years old.</p>
            <p class="list-for-tigers">Since every tiger has their own pattern on their fur, they are all unique!</p>
            <p class="list-for-tigers">These subspecies are the Bengal tiger, South China tiger, Indochinese tiger, Sumatran tiger and Amur tiger (also known as Siberian tiger).</p>
            <p class="list-for-tigers">Sadly, three subspecies of tiger have become extinct – the Caspian, Bali and Javan.</p>
            <p class="list-for-tigers">Sadly, hunting and habitat loss have put populations at risk, and today their range has been reduced to around 7% of its former size.</p>
            <p class="list-for-tigers-faveroute">That’s why we need to do all we can to protect these beautiful beasts!</p>
